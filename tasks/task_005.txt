# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enforce MEXC API rate limits and protect against abuse.
# Details:
Use Encore.ts middleware to track and limit requests per API key. Store counters in Redis (via Encore.ts). Example: `redis.incr(key)` and check against limit. Return 429 on exceedance.

# Test Strategy:
Test with rapid requests. Verify rate limiting and error responses.
