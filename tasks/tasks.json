      "title": "Task #33: Create Comprehensive AI Integration Documentation for Project",
      "description": "Update project documentation with detailed guides for AI integration, API endpoints, configuration setup for Gemini API keys, and usage examples for all AI-enhanced features.",
      "details": "The documentation update should include:\n\n1. **AI Integration Guide**:\n   - Overview of the AI capabilities integrated into the project\n   - Architecture diagrams showing how AI components interact with existing systems\n   - Step-by-step integration instructions for developers\n   - Best practices for AI feature implementation\n   - Limitations and considerations when using AI features\n\n2. **API Endpoints Documentation**:\n   - Complete documentation for all AI-related endpoints\n   - Request/response formats with JSON examples\n   - Authentication requirements\n   - Rate limiting information\n   - Error codes and troubleshooting\n   - Special focus on the health check endpoint (/mcp/health) from Task #32\n\n3. **Configuration Setup Guide**:\n   - Detailed instructions for obtaining Gemini API keys\n   - Environment variable configuration\n   - Security best practices for API key management\n   - Configuration options for different environments (dev, staging, production)\n   - Troubleshooting common configuration issues\n\n4. **Usage Examples**:\n   - Code snippets demonstrating how to use each AI-enhanced feature\n   - Complete working examples for common use cases\n   - Integration examples with the MCP service structure from Task #31\n   - Sample implementations for market analysis and trading tools\n   - Examples of handling AI service responses and errors\n\n5. **Testing Documentation**:\n   - Guide on how to use the AI integration test suite from Task #29\n   - Instructions for writing additional tests\n   - Test coverage expectations\n\nThe documentation should be written in Markdown format and organized in a logical structure within the project's docs directory. All code examples should be properly formatted and tested to ensure accuracy.",
      "testStrategy": "The documentation will be verified through the following steps:\n\n1. **Documentation Review**:\n   - Conduct a peer review with at least two team members to ensure accuracy and completeness\n   - Verify all sections (Integration Guide, API Endpoints, Configuration Setup, Usage Examples) are present and comprehensive\n   - Check that all dependencies on Tasks #29, #31, and #32 are properly documented\n\n2. **Technical Accuracy Verification**:\n   - Test all code examples to ensure they work as documented\n   - Verify API endpoint documentation matches actual implementation\n   - Confirm configuration instructions result in a working setup\n   - Validate that all AI-enhanced features are properly documented\n\n3. **User Testing**:\n   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the AI integration attempt to set up and use the features following only the documentation\n   - Document any points of confusion or missing information\n   - Incorporate feedback to improve clarity\n\n4. **Documentation Build Test**:\n   - Ensure documentation renders correctly in the project's documentation system\n   - Check that all links between documentation sections work properly\n   - Verify code syntax highlighting works correctly\n\n5. **Completeness Check**:\n   - Create a checklist of all AI features implemented in Tasks #29, #31, and #32\n   - Verify each feature has corresponding documentation\n   - Ensure the health check endpoint from Task #32 is fully documented\n   - Confirm the MCP service structure from Task #31 is properly explained\n\nThe task will be considered complete when all verification steps pass and the documentation is merged into the main branch.",
