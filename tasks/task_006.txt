# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Market Data API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement endpoints for real-time ticker prices, order book, and market statistics.
# Details:
Create REST endpoints using Encore.ts. Fetch data from MEXC REST API. Cache responses in Redis. Example: `fetch('https://api.mexc.com/api/v3/ticker/price')`. Use Zod for response validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test data retrieval, caching, and validation. Verify response times <200ms.
