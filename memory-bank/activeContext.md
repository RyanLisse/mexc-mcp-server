## Current Status
**Status**: Core Implementation Phase - Authentication Middleware
**Date**: December 19, 2024
**Current Task**: Task 3 - Implement Authentication Middleware (IN PROGRESS)

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Authentication Middleware**: Implementing Encore.ts middleware for API key validation
2. **Security**: Ensuring secure request handling with proper error responses
3. **Integration**: Connecting auth middleware with rate limiting

## Current Taskmaster Task
**Task ID**: 3
**Task**: Implement Authentication Middleware
**Status**: in-progress
**Dependencies**: Task 1 ✅, Task 2 ✅

## Major Achievements This Session
1. **✅ Task 1 Completed**: Setup Project Repository
   - Encore.ts service architecture with modular structure
   - TypeScript with strict type safety and Zod validation
   - All files under 500 lines, zero hardcoded secrets

2. **✅ Task 2 Completed**: Configure Secrets Management & CI/CD
   - Husky pre-commit hooks working perfectly
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows operational
   - Encore.ts secrets management for MEXC API keys
   - 100% test coverage for auth module

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement Encore.ts authentication middleware
2. Add API key validation with Zod schemas
3. Integrate rate limiting with auth middleware
4. Add comprehensive middleware tests
5. Update documentation

## Technical Foundation Established
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated quality gates
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks preventing bad commits
- ✅ Encore.ts secrets management
- ✅ Type-safe codebase with Zod validation
- ✅ Modular service architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Current Blockers
None identified - solid foundation in place for middleware implementation.
