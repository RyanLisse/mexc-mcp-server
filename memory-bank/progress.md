# Project Progress

## Overall Status
**Current Phase**: Memory Bank Initialization  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  
**Project Health**: Green (Ready for development)

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 0: Project Foundation âœ…
- [x] Memory Bank structure created
- [x] Project brief and context documentation
- [x] Technical architecture patterns defined
- [x] Security and secret management strategy established

### Phase 1: Project Assessment (Pending)
- [ ] Taskmaster integration assessment
- [ ] Existing code review and analysis
- [ ] Current implementation status evaluation
- [ ] Development priorities identification

## Current Development Status

### Modules Status
- **`/auth`**: Status unknown (requires assessment)
- **`/market-data`**: Status unknown (requires assessment)  
- **`/shared`**: Status unknown (requires assessment)
- **Root files**: Basic project structure exists

### Key Areas Needing Assessment
1. **MCP Server Implementation**: Current completeness level
2. **MEXC API Integration**: Existing functionality and gaps
3. **Authentication Module**: Security implementation status
4. **Market Data Module**: Available endpoints and features
5. **Testing Coverage**: Current test suite status

## Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Taskmaster Integration**: Connect with existing task management
2. **Code Assessment**: Review current implementation status
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing functionality
4. **Priority Setting**: Establish development roadmap

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Known Issues (To Be Discovered)
- TBD based on code assessment

### Potential Areas of Concern
- File size compliance (enforce <500 lines per file)
- Secret management implementation
- MCP protocol compliance
- MEXC API rate limiting handling
- Error handling consistency

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality (Pending Assessment)
- **File Size Compliance**: TBD
- **Test Coverage**: TBD  
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Appears configured
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome configured

### Performance Metrics (Baseline TBD)
- **API Response Times**: Not yet measured
- **Memory Usage**: Not yet measured
- **Error Rates**: Not yet measured

## Documentation Status
- [x] Memory Bank documentation complete
- [ ] API documentation assessment needed
- [ ] Setup instructions review needed
- [ ] Deployment documentation assessment needed

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- MEXC API access (requires API keys)
- MCP protocol libraries (appear to be configured)
- Bun runtime environment

### Current Blockers
None identified at memory bank initialization.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Memory Bank system established
- Basic project structure exists
- Modern TypeScript/Bun stack configured

### Medium Risk Items  
- Unknown current implementation completeness
- Potential technical debt in existing code
- MCP protocol compliance verification needed

### High Risk Items
None identified at current stage.

## Next Sprint Goals
1. Complete project assessment via Taskmaster
2. Establish current development status
3. Create prioritized development roadmap
4. Begin development workflow following SPARC methodology

## Long-term Roadmap (Tentative)
1. **Core MCP Server**: Complete basic MCP tool implementation
2. **Market Data API**: Full MEXC market data integration
3. **Authentication**: Secure API key management
4. **Advanced Features**: Real-time data streaming, caching
5. **Production Ready**: Testing, documentation, deployment

## Team Collaboration Notes
- Memory Bank system ready for collaborative development
- Structured development process (SPARC) established
- Taskmaster integration pending for task coordination
- Clear modular architecture principles documented
