# Project Progress

## Overall Status
**Current Phase**: Core Implementation & CI/CD
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024
**Project Health**: Green (Active development with working CI/CD)

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 0: Project Foundation âœ…
- [x] Memory Bank structure created
- [x] Project brief and context documentation
- [x] Technical architecture patterns defined
- [x] Security and secret management strategy established

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Repository âœ… (Task 1)
- [x] Taskmaster integration and task management setup
- [x] Encore.ts service architecture implementation
- [x] TypeScript configuration with strict type safety
- [x] Modular service structure (auth, market-data, shared)
- [x] Zod validation throughout codebase
- [x] All files under 500 lines, no hardcoded secrets

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline & Secrets Management âœ… (Task 2)
- [x] Husky pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting, tests)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow with comprehensive checks
- [x] GitHub Actions deployment workflow for Encore Cloud
- [x] Encore.ts secrets management implementation
- [x] Biome.js configuration with proper ignore patterns
- [x] 100% test coverage for auth module
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and README

### Phase 3: Authentication Middleware ðŸ”„ (Task 3 - IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Encore.ts authentication middleware implementation
- [ ] API key validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Rate limiting integration
- [ ] Secure request handling
- [ ] Comprehensive auth tests

## Current Development Status

### Modules Status
- **`/auth`**: âœ… Core auth logic complete, API endpoints implemented
- **`/market-data`**: âœ… MEXC client and tools implemented, API endpoints ready
- **`/shared`**: âœ… Types, utils, config, and secrets management complete
- **Root files**: âœ… Encore.ts services and main API endpoints implemented

### Current Task: Authentication Middleware (Task 3)
**Status**: In Progress
**Focus**: Implementing Encore.ts middleware for API key validation and secure request handling

### Technical Achievements
- âœ… Zero hardcoded secrets (all via Encore.ts secrets)
- âœ… Automated quality gates preventing bad commits
- âœ… Type-safe codebase with Zod validation
- âœ… Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Production-ready CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… 100% test coverage for auth module

### Next Priorities
1. Complete authentication middleware (Task 3)
2. Implement comprehensive market data integration tests
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Performance optimization and caching improvements
5. **Testing Coverage**: Current test suite status

## Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Taskmaster Integration**: Connect with existing task management
2. **Code Assessment**: Review current implementation status
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing functionality
4. **Priority Setting**: Establish development roadmap

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Known Issues (To Be Discovered)
- TBD based on code assessment

### Potential Areas of Concern
- File size compliance (enforce <500 lines per file)
- Secret management implementation
- MCP protocol compliance
- MEXC API rate limiting handling
- Error handling consistency

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality (Pending Assessment)
- **File Size Compliance**: TBD
- **Test Coverage**: TBD  
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Appears configured
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome configured

### Performance Metrics (Baseline TBD)
- **API Response Times**: Not yet measured
- **Memory Usage**: Not yet measured
- **Error Rates**: Not yet measured

## Documentation Status
- [x] Memory Bank documentation complete
- [ ] API documentation assessment needed
- [ ] Setup instructions review needed
- [ ] Deployment documentation assessment needed

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- MEXC API access (requires API keys)
- MCP protocol libraries (appear to be configured)
- Bun runtime environment

### Current Blockers
None identified at memory bank initialization.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Memory Bank system established
- Basic project structure exists
- Modern TypeScript/Bun stack configured

### Medium Risk Items  
- Unknown current implementation completeness
- Potential technical debt in existing code
- MCP protocol compliance verification needed

### High Risk Items
None identified at current stage.

## Next Sprint Goals
1. Complete project assessment via Taskmaster
2. Establish current development status
3. Create prioritized development roadmap
4. Begin development workflow following SPARC methodology

## Long-term Roadmap (Tentative)
1. **Core MCP Server**: Complete basic MCP tool implementation
2. **Market Data API**: Full MEXC market data integration
3. **Authentication**: Secure API key management
4. **Advanced Features**: Real-time data streaming, caching
5. **Production Ready**: Testing, documentation, deployment

## Team Collaboration Notes
- Memory Bank system ready for collaborative development
- Structured development process (SPARC) established
- Taskmaster integration pending for task coordination
- Clear modular architecture principles documented
