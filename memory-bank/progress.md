4. âœ… Caching and performance optimizations
5. âœ… Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

## Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Taskmaster Integration**: Connect with existing task management
2. **Code Assessment**: Review current implementation status
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing functionality
4. **Priority Setting**: Establish development roadmap

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Known Issues (To Be Discovered)
- TBD based on code assessment

### Potential Areas of Concern
- File size compliance (enforce <500 lines per file)
- Secret management implementation
- MCP protocol compliance
- MEXC API rate limiting handling
- Error handling consistency

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality (Pending Assessment)
- **File Size Compliance**: TBD
- **Test Coverage**: TBD  
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Appears configured
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome configured

### Performance Metrics (Baseline TBD)
- **API Response Times**: Not yet measured
- **Memory Usage**: Not yet measured
- **Error Rates**: Not yet measured

## Documentation Status
- [x] Memory Bank documentation complete
- [ ] API documentation assessment needed
- [ ] Setup instructions review needed
- [ ] Deployment documentation assessment needed

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- MEXC API access (requires API keys)
- MCP protocol libraries (appear to be configured)
- Bun runtime environment

### Current Blockers
None identified at memory bank initialization.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Memory Bank system established
- Basic project structure exists
- Modern TypeScript/Bun stack configured

### Medium Risk Items  
- Unknown current implementation completeness
- Potential technical debt in existing code
- MCP protocol compliance verification needed

### High Risk Items
None identified at current stage.

## Next Sprint Goals
1. Complete project assessment via Taskmaster
2. Establish current development status
3. Create prioritized development roadmap
4. Begin development workflow following SPARC methodology

## Long-term Roadmap (Tentative)
1. **Core MCP Server**: Complete basic MCP tool implementation
2. **Market Data API**: Full MEXC market data integration
3. **Authentication**: Secure API key management
4. **Advanced Features**: Real-time data streaming, caching
5. **Production Ready**: Testing, documentation, deployment

## Team Collaboration Notes
- Memory Bank system ready for collaborative development
- Structured development process (SPARC) established
- Taskmaster integration pending for task coordination
- Clear modular architecture principles documented
